                    <p><b>Itinerary</b> - We will start by getting accustomed to the ATVs 
                    and learning how to operate them safely. We will then head directly to
                    the secret trails, looking for wild horses and water buffalo. There are
                    sprawling views of Dalat and the forest with wild orchids, rare birds, 
                    and spectacular city and Langbiang views. This will be our first location 
                    to take photos and videos of the countryside. Next, we continue through 
                    local strawberry, artichoke, coffee, green tea, bell pepper, banana, and 
                    vegetable farms. During the rainy season, we will go through some mud and 
                    streams, so wear sporty clothing and closed-toed shoes. We will then drive 
                    on mountain ridges to the highest peak and enjoy 360-degree views of the 
                    Golden Valley and Lakes. We can then take the lake drive back or go through 
                    the Dalat pine forest past buffalo pools. We will finish with a drink of your 
                    choice at my resort.</p>

                    <p><b>Itinerary</b> - We will start at my resort, about 12 minutes from Dalat's 
                    city center, and get acquainted with an ATV, dirt bike, or scooter of your choice. 
                    Boots, helmet, gloves, and gear will be provided. I will give a detailed itinerary 
                    of the day's plans, stops, and landmarks we will visit. We will then proceed 
                    to hidden Dalat mountain trails, including lakes and rivers, and backcountry roads. 
                    There will be plenty of photo opportunities with water buffalo, wild horses,

                    views. Afterward, we will have an easy ride back through hidden trails and backroads 
                    only known by locals and farmers. All guests will be asked about their riding skill 
                    level beforehand and given time to become accustomed to their vehicle. There are 
                    trails and roads rated for beginners up to advanced. ATV and dirt bike trails will 
                    provide different experiences, as one can go where the other cannot. All trails are 
                    based on weather conditions. You can also choose to ride with a guide if you feel 
                    more comfortable.</p>
