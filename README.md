# Personal Portfolio Website 
---
## Description
This is my personal portfolio website, created using VS Code and comprises of HTML, CSS and JavaScript. I created the site to house my projects and be a platform to show my skills through the site itself and the various works it contains. 

As this is my first draft of a personal website I learned a lot through the project and it has made me eager to learn more. I especially enjoyed making the elements that are interactable and would like to develop and hone these skills.


**The site contents are as follows:**
- Title --- *A simple title with a border animation.*
- About Me --- *A brief paragraph about myself.*
- Skills --- *My current skills and the technology I can use.*
- Projects --- *A carousel of the projects I have completed.*
- Contact --- *A contact form that sends me an email.*

## The Future
I plan to update the site and its code as my skills develop as well as adding future projects to the carousel.
